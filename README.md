# Library-Management-System
A simple Library Management System built using C++ that allows users to manage books efficiently. It includes features such as adding new books, issuing and returning books, searching for books, and maintaining records using file handling. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, and file handling.

**Key Features:
User Authentication: The system provides a login option for both admins and students, protected by a password.

**Implementation Details:
The application is implemented in C++ without using classes, pointers, or structures. It employs 2D arrays, functions, loops, if-else, and switch operators to achieve the desired functionality. The main() function handles user inputs, presents options to the user, and calls appropriate functions based on the selected options. The program runs in a loop until the user decides to exit.
This project is suitable for students who have completed a Programming Fundamentals course or lab and want to demonstrate their skills in C++ programming without using advanced concepts like classes or pointers. It provides a solid foundation for further learning and improvement in C++ and software development.
